# What to know about your new Ockam subscription 

Welcome to Ockam. 

There are a couple things that we want you to be aware of as you start your 
subscription. 

* Refer to the [EULA](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-wsd42efzcpsxk#usage-information), [terms of service](https://www.ockam.io/policies/terms), and [Ockam pricing page](https://www.ockam.io/pricing) for subscription 
details. 
* You've initiated a  14 day free trial period.
* Free trials have a data rate cap of 1GB/day. However data transfer will be 
free during your free trial period.
* You can cancel this trial at any time by sending an email to sales@ockam.io. 
* Your paid subscription will automatically start at the conclusion of the free 
trial. 
* You can cancel, downgrade, or upgrade your paid subscription at any time.
* Since you will be paying for each period (month, or annual) upfront, your 
canceled subscription will continue to be usable until the end of the period 
that you've paid for.
* You may incur additional overage charges for data transfer costs. Consult the 
[pricing page](https://www.ockam.io/pricing) for data transfer costs.
