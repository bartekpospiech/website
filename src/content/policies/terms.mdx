Last Modified: March 7, 2024

These Terms of Service (these “**_Terms_**”) describe your rights and responsibilities when using the software distribution, web-based software platform and related services, including but not limited to the SaaS platform (the “**_Services_**”) offered by OCKAM INC. (or its successors or assigns) (“**Ockam**”, “**_we_**”, “**_our_**”, or “**_us_**”). If you are a Customer (defined below), these Terms govern your access and use of our Services. These Terms (or, if applicable, your written agreement with us) together with all documents referenced herein form the “**_Agreement_**” between Customer and us. These Terms do not cover your use of and responsibilities in accessing and using Ockam’s open source tools, available at https://github.com/build-trust (the “**Open Source Services**”). The Open Source Services are subject to separate terms and conditions which are available at https://github.com/build-trust/ockam?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file#readme.

**_Please read these Terms carefully to ensure you understand each provision. These Terms contain a jury trial waiver provision and a mandatory arbitration provision._**

If you subscribe to, or access or use the Services, create an organization, invite users to that organization, or use or allow use of that organization after being notified of a change to these Terms, you acknowledge your understanding of the then-current Agreement and agree to the Agreement on behalf of Customer. Please make sure you have the necessary authority to enter into the Agreement on behalf of Customer before proceeding.

1. **General Provisions**

   1. **Customers, Authorized Users, and Customer Content**<br/><br/>
   “**_Customer_**” or “**_you_**” is either you, if you are an individual entering into the Agreement on your own behalf, or the organization that you represent in agreeing to the Agreement. If your organization is being set up by someone who is not formally affiliated with a business entity or other organization, Customer is the individual creating the organization. If you signed up for a subscription plan using your corporate email domain or are otherwise entering into a subscription plan on behalf of a business entity or other organization, the business entity or other organization on whose behalf you signed up is the Customer. By signing up on behalf of your business entity or other organization, you represent and warrant that you have all right, power, and authority to bind such entity or organization to the Agreement.<br/><br/>
   Individuals authorized by Customer to access the Services (each an “**_Authorized User_**”) may provide content that consists of videos, images, music, comments, questions, information, documents, spreadsheets, and any other content submitted, posted, or otherwise made available by Customer and its Authorized Users through the Services (“**_Customer Content_**”), and Customer will have the sole right and responsibility for managing your use of it. Customer will be solely responsible for all of the acts and omissions of its Authorized Users in relation to the Services and the Agreement. The Services are not intended for and should not be used by anyone under the age of 18. Customer must ensure that all Authorized Users are over 18 years old or represents and warrants that Customer’s parent or legal guardian has given consent to Customer’s assent to this Agreement.<br/><br/>
   Customer will (i) inform Authorized Users of all Customer policies and practices that are relevant to their use of the Services and of any settings that may impact the processing of Customer Content; and (ii) obtain all rights, permissions or consents from Authorized Users and other Customer personnel that are necessary to grant the rights and licenses in the Agreement and for the lawful use and transmission of Customer Content and the operation of the Services.

   2. **Subscriptions**<br/><br/>
   A subscription allows Customer and its Authorized Users to access the Services. A subscription may be procured (i) through the Services interface, (ii) through a third party cloud marketplace, or (iii) via an order form entered into between Customer and us (such form, an “**_Order Form_**”). Subscriptions commence when we make them available to Customer and continue for the term specified in the Services, the marketplace, or in the Order Form, each as applicable (the “**_Subscription Period_**”).

   3. **Beta Products**<br/><br/>
   Occasionally, we look for beta testers to help us test our new features. These features will be identified as “beta” or “pre-release,” or words or phrases with similar meanings (each, a “**_Beta Product_**”). Beta Products are made available on an “as is,” and “as available” basis and, to the extent permitted under applicable law, without any warranties or contractual commitments we make for other Services.

   4. **Feedback**<br/><br/>
   Customer and its Authorized Users may choose to, or we may invite them to, submit comments or ideas about the Services, including without limitation about how to improve the Services or our products (“**_Feedback_**”). By submitting any Feedback, Customer agrees that its disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction and will not place us under any fiduciary or other obligation, and Customer hereby assigns to us all right, title, and interest in and to the Feedback without any additional compensation by us, whether to Customer, the Authorized User, or anyone else, and/or to disclose the Feedback on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone. Customer further acknowledges that, by acceptance of the submission, we do not waive any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to us, or developed by our personnel, or obtained from sources other than Customer or its Authorized Users.

2. **Services Usage and Restrictions**

   1. **Our License to Customer**

      1. **Ownership of the Services, Documentation, and Company Data**<br/><br/>
      We own and will continue to own our Services and Documentation, including all related intellectual property and other proprietary rights related thereto. Further, Customer acknowledges and agrees that we may collect data relating to Customer’s and its Authorized Users’ usage of the Services, including but not limited to the number of connections to the Service, the volume of data transferred or moved through the Service, infrastructure and environment context, features, errors, and user workflows (collectively, “**_Usage Data_**”), and collect, analyze, and use data derived from Customer Content that has been aggregated and/or anonymized such that it does not identify Customer or any identifiable individual person (“**_Derivative Data_**” and, collectively with Usage Data, “**_Company Data_**”). All Company Data will be owned solely and exclusively by us and, for purposes of clarity, you agree that we may use the Company Data in perpetuity for any purpose permitted by applicable law.<br/><br/>
      We may, from time to time, make available certain third-party products and services, including but not limited to open source software (“**_Third-Party Products_**”) for use in connection with the Services. Such Third-Party Products may be made available under separate or additional terms and conditions, including but not limited to open source licenses, which we will make available to you as necessary.

      2. **Licenses to the Services and Documentation**<br/><br/>
      During the Subscription Period, we grant the Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and use, and to permit Authorized Users to access and use the Services, in accordance with the Agreement, for the Customer’s own internal business purposes.<br/><br/>
      To the extent that we may make downloadable software components available, via app stores or other channels, as part of the Services, During the Subscription Period, we grant to Customer a non-sublicensable, non-transferable, non-exclusive, limited license for Customer and its Authorized Users to use the object code version of these components, but solely as necessary to use the Services. Minor updates, bug fixes, and the like to such downloadable software components will be included under this license for the duration of the subscription.<br/><br/>
      From time to time we may make available product documentation for the Services (the “**_Documentation_**”) via a method of our choosing (_e.g._, via the Services). During the Subscription Period, we grant to Customer a non-sublicensable, non-transferable, non-exclusive, limited license for Customer and its Authorized Users to use the Documentation to support Customer’s and its Authorized Users’ use of the Services.<br/><br/>
      All rights and licenses granted herein are subject to you and your Authorized Users’ full compliance with all of the terms and conditions of the Agreement. All rights in the Services and Documentation not expressly granted herein are expressly reserved by us.

   2. **Customer’s Licenses to Us**

      1. **Ownership of Customer Content**<br/><br/>
      As between us on the one hand, and Customer and any Authorized Users on the other, Customer (or your licensors) will own all Customer Content.

      2. **License to Customer Content**<br/><br/>
      Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Customer (for itself and all of its Authorized Users) represents and warrants that it has all rights necessary to grant (including any necessary consents and authorizations from individual persons identified in the Customer Content and licenses from third-parties whose content is included in the Customer Content), to us a royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, license to access, use, host, store, reproduce, modify, publish, list information regarding, translate, process, copy, distribute, perform, export, display, and make derivative works of all Customer Content, and the names, voice, and/or likeness contained in the Customer Content, in whole or in part, and in any form, media, or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, (i) to provide, improve, enhance, develop, maintain and offer products or services; (ii) to prevent or address service, security, support or technical issues; (iii) as required by law; and (iv) as expressly permitted in writing by Customer. Customer represents and warrants that it has secured all rights in and to Customer Content from its Authorized Users or any third parties as may be necessary to grant this license.<br/><br/>
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer agrees that we may collect, analyze, use and disclose, during or after the Subscription Period, data derived from Customer Content, which is anonymized and/or aggregated in a manner, that makes the identification of Customer or any Authorized User or third party impossible, for any business purpose, including without limitation, to operate, analyze, improve, and market the Services and our other products and services and share such anonymized data with our affiliates and business partners. Customer further agrees that we will have the perpetual right to use, store, transmit, distribute, modify, copy, display, sublicense, and create derivative works of such derived data.<br/><br/>
      To the extent permitted under applicable law, we take no responsibility and assume no liability for any Customer Content that Customer or any Authorized User or third-party submits, posts, or otherwise makes available through the Services. As between Customer and us, Customer shall be fully responsible for the Customer Content and the consequences of submitting, posting, or otherwise making it available via the Services, and Customer acknowledges and agrees that we are acting only as a passive conduit for Customer’s and its Authorized Users’ online distribution of such Customer Content.

   3. **Responsibilities for Customer Content**<br/><br/>
   We are not responsible for the content of any Customer Content or the way Customer or its Authorized Users choose to use the Services to store or process any Customer Content. Customer represents and agrees that Customer is solely responsible for (i) providing notices and obtaining consents as legally required from its Authorized Users for the collection, use, processing and transfer of Customer Content in connection with the Services; and (ii) ensuring compliance with all laws in all jurisdictions that may apply to Customer Content provided hereunder, including but not limited to all applicable international, federal, state, provincial and local laws, rules, and regulations relating to data privacy and security. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing, Customer may not submit any Customer Content that includes a social security number, passport number, driver’s license number, or similar identifier, credit card or debit card number, or any other information which may be subject to specific data privacy and security laws including, but not limited to, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HiTECH), the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA),or the GDPR or any other data which is considered to be sensitive or which could give rise to notification obligations under data breach notification laws. We do not make any representations as to the adequacy of the Service to process your Customer Content or to satisfy any legal or compliance requirements which may apply to your Customer Content, other than as described herein. 

   4. **Use of the Services**<br/><br/>
   Customer must comply with the Agreement and ensure that its Authorized Users comply with the Agreement. We may review conduct for compliance purposes, but we have no obligation to do so. If we believe there is a violation of the Agreement that can be remedied by Customer’s removal of certain Customer Content, we will, in most cases, ask Customer to take direct action rather than intervene. However, to the extent legally permissible, we reserve the right to take further appropriate action, when we deem it reasonably appropriate if Customer does not take appropriate action, or if we believe there is a credible risk of harm to us, the Services, Authorized Users, or any third parties.

   5. **Acceptable Use**

      1. **Services Restrictions**<br/><br/>

To the extent legally permissible, we reserve the right, but are not obligated, to reject and/or remove any Customer Content that we believe, in our sole discretion, violates any of these provisions.

3. **Payment Obligations**

    1. **Payment Terms**<br/><br/>
    For Customers that purchase a subscription to use our Services (whether directly through the Services or through a third party cloud marketplace), fees are specified through your online account or through your cloud marketplace. The Services may also include fees that are calculated and charged as more specifically described in the interface specific to the Services you are using. Payment obligations are non-cancelable once incurred subject to your cancellation rights in these Terms. Except as expressly stated in the Agreement, fees paid are non-refundable. For clarity, in the event Customer downgrades any subscriptions or other recurring fees, Customer will remain responsible for any unpaid fees under the paid plan, and Services under the paid plan will be deemed fully performed and delivered upon expiration of the initial Subscription Period. Fees are stated exclusive of any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, **“_Taxes_”**). Customer will be responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its purchases, except for those taxes based on our net income.

    2. **Billing Policies**<br/><br/>
    If you elect to purchase a subscription to use our Services, or any other paid aspects of the Services, Customer agrees to the pricing communicated to you by us. We may add new services for additional fees and charges, or add or amend fees and charges for existing services, at any time in our sole discretion, by giving to Customer at least thirty (30) calendar days' written notice, such increase to take effect at the beginning of the next billing cycle. If Customer is unhappy with the increase, Customer may give notice to terminate the Agreement, by giving at least thirty (30) calendar days' written notice to us prior to the next billing date, such notice to expire no later than the end of the then-current billing cycle. The fees will not increase during the notice period; otherwise, any change to such pricing shall become effective in the billing cycle following notice of such change as provided under the Agreement.

    3. **Billing and Cancellation**<br/><br/>
    To use the Services, you must provide one or more current, valid accepted payment method, as may be updated from time to time and which may include payment through your account with a third party (such method, a “**_Payment Method_**”). By providing a Payment Method, you agree that we or our Payment Processor (defined below) are authorized to periodically charge the applicable fees in addition to any applicable taxes and service fees on a recurring basis until you cancel your subscription or other such recurring fees. The fees for the Services and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the Services, such as taxes and possible transaction fees, will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date indicated on your account. The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription that you choose when you signed up for the Services. Fees are fully earned upon payment. In some cases, your payment date may change, for example, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled, when you change your subscription plan or if your paid subscription began on a date not contained in a given month. We may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of service-related charges through various methods, including authorizing it up to one month of service as soon as you register.

    4. **Payment Information**<br/><br/>
    All payments for the Services are handled through the AWS Marketplace (our “**Payment Processor**”). We or our Payment Processor will attempt to verify the Payment Method you provide, and may do so by processing an authorization hold, which is standard practice. Please see Payment Processor’s privacy statement available on its website for information on how Payment Processor collects and uses personal information. Payment must be received by Payment Processor before our acceptance of an order, and must use one of the payment methods accepted by the Payment Processor. We do not view or store your full credit card or other Payment Method information. For all payments, Payment Processor will collect your Payment Method details and charge your chosen Payment Method in connection with an order. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for any breaches of credit card or other Payment Method security or privacy.<br/><br/>
    You represent and warrant that: (i) the account, order, and Payment Method information you supply to us or Payment Processor, as applicable, is true, correct, and complete; (ii) you are duly authorized to use such Payment Method; (iii) you will pay any charges that you incur in connection with the Services, including any applicable taxes; (iv) charges incurred by you will be honored by your Payment Method company; (v) you will pay all charges incurred by you at the posted prices, including all applicable taxes, if any; (vi) you will not allow anyone else to use your subscription; (vii) you will not transfer your subscription or password to anyone else; and (viii) you will report to us any unauthorized or prohibited access or use of your subscription or password.<br/><br/>
    If any of your account, order, or Payment Method information changes, you agree to promptly update this information, so that we or Payment Processor may complete your transactions and contact you as needed. We are not liable for any unauthorized use of your credit card, debit card, or other Payment Method by a third-party in connection with your use of the Services or your subscription.

    5. **Cancellation**<br/><br/>
    YOU CAN CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME BY PROVIDING US WITH AT LEAST THIRTY (30) CALENDAR DAYS NOTICE PRIOR TO YOUR NEXT SUBSCRIPTION BILLING OF YOUR INTENT TO CANCEL. YOU MUST CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE IT RENEWS IN ORDER TO AVOID BEING CHARGED FOR THE NEXT CYCLE’S FEES. If you cancel your subscription, the cancellation will become effective at the end of the then-current Subscription Period and you will continue to have access to your subscription through your account. If you cancel your subscription, we will retain your information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
    
    6. **Refunds**<br/><br/>
    EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS, UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE DO NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS FOR ANY SUBSCRIPTION OR LOCATIONS; NOR DO WE PROVIDE CREDIT, REFUNDS, OR PRORATED BILLING FOR SUBSCRIPTIONS THAT ARE CANCELLED.

4. **Term and Termination**

    1. **Agreement Term**<br/><br/>
    As further described below, a free subscription continues until terminated, while a paid subscription has a Subscription Period that may expire or be terminated. The Agreement remains effective until all subscriptions ordered under the Agreement have expired or been terminated or the Agreement itself terminates. Termination of the Agreement will terminate all subscriptions.

    2. **Auto-Renewal**<br/><br/>
    Unless otherwise set forth in an Order Form, (i) all subscriptions automatically renew for additional periods equal to one (1) month orl the preceding Subscription Period, whichever is shorter; and (ii) the per-unit pricing during any automatic renewal Subscription Period will be the then-current price communicated to you by us. Either party can give the other notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days before the end of a Subscription Period to stop a subscription from automatically renewing.

    3. **Termination for Cause**<br/><br/>
    We or Customer may terminate the Agreement on notice to the other party if the other party materially breaches the Agreement and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days after the non-breaching party provides notice of the breach. Customer is responsible for its Authorized Users, including for any breaches of the Agreement caused by its Authorized Users. We may terminate the Agreement immediately on notice to Customer if we reasonably believe that the Services are being used by Customer or its Authorized Users in violation of applicable law.

    4. **Termination Without Cause**<br/><br/>
    Unless otherwise set forth in an Order Form, Customer may terminate its free subscriptions immediately without cause. We may also terminate the Agreement without cause, but we will provide Customer with thirty (30) days prior written notice.

    5. **Effect of Termination**<br/><br/>
    Upon any termination for cause by Customer, we will refund Customer any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the Subscription Period after the effective date of termination. Upon any termination for cause by us, Customer will pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the Subscription Period after the effective date of termination. In no event will any termination relieve Customer of the obligation to pay any fees payable to us for the period prior to the effective date of termination.

5. **Copyright Policy**<br/><br/>
    Since we respect artist and content owner rights, it is our policy to respond to alleged infringement notices that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (**_“DMCA”_**).<br/><br/>

6. **Additional Terms for Particular Types of Customers**

   1. **U.S. Government Customers**<br/><br/>

        1. **Use By or For the U.S. Government**. The Services are a “commercial item,” as defined at 48 C.F.R. §2.101, and constitute “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,” as used in 48 C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202 to §227.7204.

        2. **Indemnification, Auto-Renewal, Venue, Legal Fees**. The sections in the contract titled “Governing Law,” “Auto-renewal,” “Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial; Fees,” and “Customer’s Indemnification of Us” are hereby waived to the extent they are inconsistent with federal law.
        3. **No Endorsement**. We agree that Customer’s seals, trademarks, logos, service marks, trade names, and the fact that Customer has a presence on one of our sites and uses our Services, will not be used by us in such a manner as to state or imply that our products or services are endorsed, sponsored or recommended by Customer or by any other element of the U.S. Government, or are considered by Customer or the U.S. Government to be superior to any other products or services. Except for pages whose design and content is under the control of the Customer, or for links to or promotion of such pages, we agree not to display any Customer or government seals, trademarks, logos, service marks, and trade names on our homepage or elsewhere on one of our hosted sites unless permission to do so has been granted by Customer or by other relevant federal government authority.

    2. **State or Local Government Customers**<br/><br/>
    If Customer is a state or local government, the terms in this section apply, but only to the extent the Services are being used in an Authorized User’s official capacity as a state or local government official.

    3. **Healthcare Customers**<br/><br/>
    If Customer is a Covered Entity as defined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and related amendments and regulations as updated or replaced (**_“HIPAA”_**), unless Customer has entered into a written agreement with us to the contrary, Customer acknowledges that we are not a Business Associate or subcontractor (as defined in HIPAA) and that the Services are not HIPAA compliant. Customer must not submit, collect or use any “personal health information” as defined in 45 CFR §160.103 (**_“PHI”_**), with or to the Services. Further, we suggest that Customer advise Authorized Users directly that they should not transmit PHI through the Services. Customer agrees that we have no liability for PHI received from Customer, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein.

    4. **Education Professional Customers**<br/><br/>
    If Customer is a school or educator in the United States and wants its students, who are over the age of 13, to use the Services, Customer is responsible for complying with the U.S. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (**_“FERPA”_**) and all other law, rules, and regulations protecting the privacy of student data which may be applicable to Customer. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing, Customer may not submit Customer Content which contains personal information from a student’s educational record, as defined by FERPA.

YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICE OR ANY DOWNLOAD OF CONTENT THROUGH THE USE OF OUR SERVICE.<br/><br/>

    12. **Arbitration**<br/><br/>
    **_Read this section carefully because it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you may seek relief from us._** For any dispute with us, you agree to first contact us at support\@ockam.io and attempt to resolve the dispute informally. If we have not been able to resolve a dispute within sixty (60) days of your first contact, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to the Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. The arbitration will be conducted in San Francisco County, California, unless we agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Services for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing us from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights.<br/><br/>
    NOTHING IN THIS SECTION WILL BE DEEMED AS: PREVENTING US FROM SEEKING INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FROM THE COURTS AS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE ACTUAL OR THREATENED INFRINGEMENT, MISAPPROPRIATION, OR VIOLATION OF OUR DATA, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.

    13. **Entire Agreement**<br/><br/>
    The Agreement, including these Terms and all referenced pages constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals or representations, written or oral, concerning its subject matter. Without limiting the foregoing, the Agreement supersedes the terms of any online agreement electronically accepted by Customer or any Authorized Users. However, to the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions in these Terms and any other documents or pages referenced in these Terms, the following order of precedence will apply: (i) the Data Processing Addendum; (ii) these Terms; and (iii) any other documents or pages referenced in these Terms.
