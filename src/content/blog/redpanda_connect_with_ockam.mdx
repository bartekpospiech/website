Ockam teamed up with [Redpanda](https://redpanda.com/redpanda-cloud) to launch *Redpanda Connect with Ockam: the first zero-trust streaming data platform*. This is a natural partnership because both companies have the same ethos; to enable every developer to build distributed systems, at scale, with simple tools. Both companies' products are based on popular open source projects and are built by veteran, high-performing teams.

*Redpanda Connect with Ockam is the only enterprise-scale, zero-trust, streaming data platform that's simultaneously easy to deploy, secure-by-design, and highly performant.*

“Enterprise executives tell me that their high value streaming applications take a long time to build and to ship,” said Matthew Gregory, Ockam's CEO. “Their biggest obstacle is the construction of secure streaming data connections across their siloed enterprise, and between partner companies. Secure data streaming is now simple to set up, trivial to maintain, and almost impossible to mess up. We've unlocked data so application development can move fast.” 

Enterprise Kafka product vendors defer zero-trust implementation details to their customers. It's difficult, even for sophisticated engineering organizations, to pull together a team that can choose and assemble the dozens of parts required to build a secure-by-design streaming data platform. Redpanda Connect with Ockam empowers a single developer to easily create end-to-end encrypted streaming pipelines that can connect 100's of applications across clouds and hybrid infrastructure. It builds trust in data streams, eliminates sources of risk to critical data, and removes the operational complexities inherent in managing keys at scale.

Redpanda provides a declarative data streaming service that enables developers and organizations to build simple, chained, and stateless processing steps for their data pipelines. Our partnership with Redpanda brings a truly zero-trust capability to these pipelines. Ockam's cryptographic protocols and data integrity guarantees remove the risk of MITM and supply chain attacks that could otherwise tamper with data inflight and lead to data poisoning; highlighted as one of the OWASP Top 10 risks for companies that leverage AI and Large Language Model (LLM) systems. The mutual authentication and encrypted data protocols that Ockam provides also mean organizations can transmit highly sensitive data with cryptographic guarantees so only the intended recipients will be able to decrypt and process it. This will unlock new high value applications that businesses may have been unwilling to explore due to privacy and governance risk, or complexity.

“We help the world's largest companies build and scale streaming applications," said Alex Gallego, Redpanda's CEO. "Redpanda Connect with Ockam was conceived to empower our customers to build streaming data applications with ease. Redpanda Connect comes with over 200 pre-built integrations that will quickly connect to and unlock your data silos. Ockam provides the mutual authentication and end-to-end encryption that zero-trust streaming data applications require. Together with Ockam, we've abstracted away all of the complex pieces that cause engineering teams to stumble.” 

Confluent's “[2023 Data Streaming Report: Moving Up the Maturity Curve](https://assets.confluent.io/m/52436fc9cd4844f4/original/20230510-RPT-Data_Streaming_Report.pdf)” recently surveyed 2,250 IT and engineering leaders from organizations that use streaming data.
 
* 74\% cited that their streaming data applications are blocked because of fragmented projects, uncoordinated teams, and constrained engineering budgets.
* 32\% claim that they successfully “reduced security risks” after implementing data streaming services across their applications. However, 94\% have high-security expectations for these same applications.

These are alarming numbers! Despite the obvious benefits that a real-time streaming data architecture provides, companies struggle to ship data pipelines to their applications. Often, they're blocked for several quarters. Once they get to production, they realize that their data doesn't have the security guarantees that they need or expect from their streaming data infrastructure.

Redpanda Connect with Ockam aims to move these numbers to 0\% and 100\%, respectively. Let's go!

## Connect, secure, and stream&mdash;all in one simple platform

![Redpanda Connect with Ockam example flow](/blog/redpanda/redpanda-connect-ockam-example-arch.png)

### Connect with Redpanda Connect (formerly known as Benthos)

Redpanda Connect empowers engineers to build connectors and integrations to over 200 applications, including SQL, Mongo, Snowflake, Cassandra, Redis, Splunk, AWS Lambda, Azure CosmosDB, and GCP Cloud Storage. Redpanda Connect can process streaming data with transforms, mapping, filtering, hydration, and enrichment capabilities.

### Secure with Ockam

Zero-trust in your data streaming infrastructure allows you to have absolute-trust in your data and applications. Ockam adds the guarantees of data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity, so you can enforce data governance and privacy policies at scale.

Each producer creates its own unique cryptographically provable identity and encryption keys. The producers use their keys to establish trusted secure channels through Redpanda Cloud and to the consumers across the streaming platform. All the data that moves though your streaming data platform is encrypted in motion - even when it's passing through a broker. Keys, enrollments, and credentials are safely created, stored, rotated, and revoked automagically so there's almost nothing to manage.

Ockam makes it simple to Build Trust across your entire data layer - in a way that's almost impossible to mess up.

### Stream with Redpanda Cloud

Redpanda Cloud is a complete streaming data platform delivered as a fully managed service with automated upgrades and patching, data and partition balancing, and 24×7 support. It continuously monitors and maintains your clusters along with the underlying infrastructure to meet strict performance, availability, reliability, and security requirements.


## Give it a try

The example below will show you how to use Ockam to connect any input sources (e.g., MongoDB, Postgresql, a Kafka stream, etc.) to any output (e.g., Snowflake, S3, Splunk, etc.), automatically encrypting all your data in motion. You can run this complete example locally in less than 2 minutes by copying the relevant sections below. To understand in more detail what each configuration and command, and how to extend this for other uses, read on below.

First, copy the code block below and save it to a file named `consumer.yaml`:

```yaml
# consumer.yaml

input:
  ockam_kafka:
    seed_brokers: [rp-node-0:9092]
    topics: [topic_A]
    consumer_group: example_group
    ockam_allow_producer: producer
    ockam_relay: consumer_relay
    ockam_enrollment_ticket: ${OCKAM_ENROLLMENT_TICKET}

pipeline:
  processors:
    - bloblang: |
      root = this
      root.data.message = this.data.message.uppercase()

output:
  stdout: {}
  # snowflake_put:
  #   account: acme
  #   ...
```

Next, save the code block below to `producer.yaml`

```yaml
# producer.yaml

input:
  generate:
    count: 1000
    interval: "@every 1s"
    mapping: |
      root = {
        "_producer": hostname(),
        "data": { "email": fake("email"), "message": fake("sentence") }
      }
  # mongodb:
  #   url: mongodb://localhost
  #   database: orders
  #   ...

output:
  ockam_kafka:
    seed_brokers: [rp-node-0:9092]
    topic: topic_A
    ockam_route_to_consumer: /project/default/service/forward_to_consumer_relay/secure/api
    ockam_allow_consumer: consumer
    ockam_enrollment_ticket: ${OCKAM_ENROLLMENT_TICKET}
```

All that's left is to run the commands below to start the services and data will start flowing:

```bash
# Setup Redpanda

brew install redpanda-data/tap/redpanda
rpk container start

# Setup Ockam
brew install build-trust/ockam/ockam
ockam enroll

# Setup Consumer
ockam project ticket --usage-count 1 \
  --expires-in 10m --attribute consumer \
  --relay consumer_relay > ticket

docker run --rm --network redpanda \
  --name consumer -v "$(pwd)/consumer.yaml:/connect.yaml" \
  -e OCKAM_ENROLLMENT_TICKET="$(cat ticket)" ghcr.io/build-trust/redpanda-connect

# The previous command will tail the output so you can see 
# the messages flowing through the system. Run the following 
# commands in a new terminal window.

# Setup Producers
for i in $(seq 1 3); do
  ockam project ticket --usage-count 1 --expires-in 10m \
    --attribute producer > ticket

  docker run --rm -d --network redpanda \
    --name "producer$i" -v "$(pwd)/producer.yaml:/connect.yaml" \
    -e OCKAM_ENROLLMENT_TICKET="$(cat ./ticket)" ghcr.io/build-trust/redpanda-connect
done

# It can take a minute or so for the messages to start flowing.
# Observe that the above consumer can decrypt and transform messages.

# However, if you look at the messages inside redpanda console at 
# localhost:8080 or using the below rpk command, you'll notice that 
# the messages are encrypted.
rpk topic consume topic_A

# Cleanup
docker stop $(docker ps -q --filter "name=producer" --filter "name=consumer")
rpk container purge
```

### Detailed explanation of each step

Walking through the commands one-by-one will explain what each step achieves. 
Starting with getting Redpanda running locally:

```bash
brew install redpanda-data/tap/redpanda
rpk container start
```

These two commands install Redpanda and start a container. Now there is a
broker running in a container that we will use to stream and process data with
Redpanda Connect.

```bash
brew install build-trust/ockam/ockam
ockam enroll
```

The `brew` command is how you install Ockam Command into your local environment. 
`ockam enroll` will open a browser window and guide you through either [signing up
or signing in to Ockam Orchestrator](https://www.ockam.io/signup). Ockam
Orchestrator will allow you to securely manage the enrollment of thousands or more 
processing nodes without the need to manually push identities, keys, or 
credentials to each node. This initial `enroll` will establish your local machine
as an Administrator within the project that has been setup for you within Ockam
Orchestrator.

```bash
ockam project ticket --usage-count 1 \
  --expires-in 10m --attribute consumer \
  --relay consumer_relay > ticket
```

The `ockam project ticket` command is how you generate a ticket that will admit
another node into your project. The arguments here specify that:

* The ticket can is valid for use `1` time. This ensures that ticket is for the 
desired purposes and if it's inadvertently leaked there is no
opportunity for an attacker to re-use it to gain access to your project.
* A time-to-live (TTL)/expiry period of `10` minutes. This also reduces the risk
posed by a ticket leaking, you can adjust it to any time window that's
appropriate for your use case.
* An attribute of `consumer`. This will add a attribute to any node that enrolls
with this ticket, and policy definitions can then use those attributes to apply 
Attribute Based Access Controls and restrict which nodes can communicate with 
each other.
* Setup a relay named `consumer_relay`. This provides a named route for other
nodes to find this node, even if both nodes are on different network.

The output of that command, the enrollment ticket, is then redirected out to
a file named `ticket`.

```bash
docker run --rm --network redpanda \
  --name consumer -v "$(pwd)/consumer.yaml:/connect.yaml" \
  -e OCKAM_ENROLLMENT_TICKET="$(cat ticket)" ghcr.io/build-trust/redpanda-connect
```

This is where you start your consumer with Redpanda Connect. It uses Docker to 
start a new container named `consumer`, on an isolated network named `redpanda`, 
passing in the `consumer.yaml` and `ticket` files. 

The `consumer.yaml` file defines how to process any data it receives:

```yaml
input:
  ockam_kafka:
    seed_brokers: [rp-node-0:9092]
    topics: [topic_A]
    consumer_group: example_group
    ockam_allow_producer: producer
    ockam_relay: consumer_relay
    ockam_enrollment_ticket: ${OCKAM_ENROLLMENT_TICKET}
```

This input block shows the standard kafka configuration options that specify the
broker, topics, and consumer group to use. The following three lines are the 
Ockam-specific additions that allow this input source to receive and process
end-to-end encrypted data streams:

* `ockam_allow_producer`: the attribute that needs to exist on the other node before
allowing each node to establish a trusted connection between each other.
* `ockam_relay`: the name of the relay to connect this node to.
* `ockam_enrollment_ticket`: the enrollment ticket to use to admit this node into
the Ockam Orchestrator project.

```yaml
pipeline:
  processors:
    - bloblang: |
      root = this
      root.data.message = this.data.message.uppercase()
```

The pipeline and processors block does a basic transformation of receiving the
data, and converting the `message` attribute to be all in upper-case. While not
an entirely useful transformation in production, this allows you to independently
verify that the consumer was able to decrypt and process the data.

```yaml
output:
  stdout: {}
  # snowflake_put:
  #   account: acme
  #   ...
```

The last part of the `consumer.yaml` configuration is the output block. This
example implements a single `stdout` output. As the commented-out Snowflake block
highlights, other destinations can receive your final processed data stream by
providing their configuration settings alongside this example.

The code snippet for starting a data producer shows how Ockam makes enrolling any 
number of nodes painless: 

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 3); do
  ockam project ticket --usage-count 1 --expires-in 10m \
    --attribute producer > ticket

  docker run --rm -d --network redpanda \
    --name "producer$i" -v "$(pwd)/producer.yaml:/connect.yaml" \
    -e OCKAM_ENROLLMENT_TICKET="$(cat ./ticket)" ghcr.io/build-trust/redpanda-connect
done
```

The `for i in $(seq 1 3); do` line creates a `for` loop that will create `3` 
separate containers. Each container will generate a unique identity, enroll into
the Ockam Orchestrator project, and establish a secure channel with the consumer
node. If you feel ambitious you can increase that `3` to a higher number, just
be aware Docker will run a new container for each node so you could quickly
exhaust your local system resources.

The `ockam project ticket` command generates an enrollment ticket, just as it 
did in the earlier section that explained the setup of the consumer. The primary
difference with this ticket is that the attribute is set to `producer` and there
is no need to setup a relay for a producer.

The `docker run` command runs the same image as before, on the same network,
giving each image unique name with a prefix of `producer`, and passing in
the `producer.yaml` and `ticket` for each node.

The `producer.yaml` configuration file has two blocks of importance:

```yaml
input:
  generate:
    count: 1000
    interval: "@every 1s"
    mapping: |
      root = {
        "_producer": hostname(),
        "data": { "email": fake("email"), "message": fake("sentence") }
      }
  # mongodb:
  #   url: mongodb://localhost
  #   database: orders
  #   ...
```

The input block here is generating random data, useful for the sake of a self-
contained demo but something you would replace in a real-world use case. On a
1 second interval new data that includes the `hostname` 
(allowing you to verify that there is 3 separate nodes producing data), and
 fake data for the `email` and `message` attributes in the payload, is sent to
the output. If you recall the explanation earlier, the `message` field is later 
processed by the consumer to be entirely in upper-case before being output 
to `stdout`.

For a real-world use case, the commented out block gives an example of how to 
use a Mongo database as the input source for a producer.

```yaml
output:
  ockam_kafka:
    seed_brokers: [rp-node-0:9092]
    topic: topic_A
    ockam_route_to_consumer: /project/default/service/forward_to_consumer_relay/secure/api
    ockam_allow_consumer: consumer
    ockam_enrollment_ticket: ${OCKAM_ENROLLMENT_TICKET}
```

The output block in `producer.yaml` contains the standard kafka configuration,
along with three Ockam-specific options:

* `ockam_route_to_consumer`: the full path to the relay that was setup for the consumer.
* `ockam_allow_consumer`: the attribute that needs to exist on the other node before
allowing each node to establish a trusted connection between each other.
* `ockam_enrollment_ticket`: the enrollment ticket to use to admit this node into
the Ockam Orchestrator project.

Now everything is setup and running. You'll see in the log output that the
consumer is receiving data, from different hosts, and that the
`message` in each payload is upper-case. If you open the
[Redpanda Console](http://localhost:8080) you'll see that the encrypted messages 
in `topic_A` are not readable by the broker or anybody else that might have 
access to the topic.

By adding or changing a few lines in the `consumer.yaml` and `producer.yaml`
files it's possible to:

* Use an existing self-hosted Redpanda broker or Redpanda Cloud instance.
* Add more inputs into `producer.yaml` and/or outputs `consumer.yaml` to 
connect, secure, and stream data between any of the hundreds
of different integrations supported by Redpanda Connect.
