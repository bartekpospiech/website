## Remove onboarding complexity

It can take weeks, or months, for a new customer to connect to your SaaS product when you ask them to
make changes to their network or infrastructure configuration. Once you close a customer you want them to 
start to consume your services right away. 

Ockam works with your product's existing solutions such as PrivateLink of VPC 
peering, but removes the need for your customers to make changes to their account. 
Your customer runs Ockam alongside your app, establishes a mutually authenticated secure 
channel, which enables trusted communication between the systems.

Your customers can have your systems connected in minutes, not weeks.

## Trust your security team can depend on

Ockam's approach uses existing and well established open source
technologies and frameworks. The cryptographic and messaging protocols are 
[publicly documented](https://docs.ockam.io/reference/protocols) and
the implementations are 
[open source and available on GitHub](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam).

Also available is a published and independent third-party audit by
the security research firm [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com).

## Trust at the application level

Traditional solutions like peering, VPNs, and maintaining allow lists - 
network-level approaches that connect entire networks to each other. To reduce
lateral movement within the networks further controls are then applied. 

By elevating trust to the application level, Ockam provides
fine-grained access controls that map to actual business needs. There's no long-standing
assumptions about networks, and secure communication guarantees 
push beyond network perimeters and system boundaries &mdash; they're
established all the way through to the applications processing your data.

## Data authenticity & integrity

The approach to mutual authentication of every app that Ockam provides results
in strong data governance guarantees around the authenticity and integrity of 
the messages moving through your system.
