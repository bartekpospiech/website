## Frictionless customer experience

Your customers get the user experience they deserve. Instead of pushing all 
the hard connectivity problems, such as setting up VPNs or changing firewall 
configurations, you can offer a holistic solution that feels like a natural
_part of your product_.

Provide them a custom `your-company-agent` to run that will have their systems
connected within minutes.

## Trust at the application level

Traditional solutions like peering, VPNs, and maintaining allow lists - 
network-level approaches that connect entire networks to each other. To reduce
lateral movement within the networks further controls are then applied. 

By elevating trust to the application level, Ockam provides
fine-grained access controls that map to actual business needs. There's no long-standing
assumptions about networks, and secure communication guarantees 
push beyond network perimeters and system boundaries &mdash; they're
established all the way through to the applications processing your data.

## Support multi-cloud deployments

Ockam's agnostic to network-level and cloud-specific features. That means no 
matter which cloud your customers are using, or if they're using multiple 
clouds, you've a single approach that works consistently wherever your customers
are. That includes other on-prem environments, data centers, or even a server 
that's under someone's desk.
