      Add a way for a customer to request a ticker. They then run your agent, 
      passing in the ticket. That's all they have to do! No managing hostnames 
      or routes, changing ingress rules on firewalls.

    text: | 
      Whenever you need to connect to the customer system start an Ockam Inlet. A 
      mutually authenticated secure portal will be immediately established. 
      And via what we call [virtual adjacency](/) the customer system will be 
      accessible as though it was running on `localhost`. All without the need to 
      for the customer to make their systems reachable from the public internet. And
      without the risk of you being able to reach anything else in their network due 
      to a misconfiguration on their end. A true point to point connection. Exactly
      what you need, and nothing more.

## Frictionless customer experience

Your customers get the user experience they deserve. Instead of pushing all 
the hard connectivity problems, such as setting up VPNs or changing firewall 
configurations, you can offer a holistic solution that feels like a natural
_part of your product_.

Provide them a custom `your-company-agent` to run that will have their systems
connected within minutes.

## Trust at the application level

Traditional solutions like peering, VPNs, and maintaining allow lists - 
network-level approaches that connect entire networks to each other. To reduce
lateral movement within the networks further controls are then applied. 

By elevating trust to the application level, Ockam provides
fine-grained access controls that map to actual business needs. There's no long-standing
assumptions about networks, and secure communication guarantees 
push beyond network perimeters and system boundaries &mdash; they're
established all the way through to the applications processing your data.

<SideBySidePanel textOrientation="right" image="multicloud">
## Support multi-cloud deployments

Ockam's agnostic to network-level and cloud-specific features. That means no 
matter which cloud your customers are using, or if they're using multiple 
clouds, you've a single approach that works consistently wherever your customers
are. That includes other on-prem environments, data centers, or even a server 
that's under someone's desk.

## Trust your security team can depend on

Ockam's approach uses existing and well established open source
technologies and frameworks. The cryptographic and messaging protocols are 
[publicly documented](https://docs.ockam.io/reference/protocols) and
the implementations are 
[open source and available on GitHub](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam).

Also available is a published and independent third-party audit by
the security research firm [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com).
