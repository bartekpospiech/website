## Remove unnecessary network complexity

Asking your customers to make changes to their network and infrastructure 
configuration to connect to your product is slowing down on-boarding and 
adoption. Replace the bureaucracy required to make network-level changes with 
the excitement of seeing value from using your product.

Ockam works with your product's existing solutions such as PrivateLink of VPC 
peering, but removes the need for your customers to make changes to their account. 
Your customer runs Ockam alongside your app, establishes a mutually authenticated secure 
channel, which enables trusted communication between the systems.

Your customers can have your systems connected in minutes, not weeks.

## Multi-cloud deployments

Ockam's agnostic to network-level and cloud-specific features. That means no 
matter which cloud your customers are using, or if they're using multiple 
clouds, you've a single approach that works consistently wherever your customers
are. That includes other on-prem environments, data centers, or even a server 
that's under someone's desk.

## Trust your security team can depend on

Ockam's approach uses existing and well established open source
technologies and frameworks. The cryptographic and messaging protocols are 
[publicly documented](https://docs.ockam.io/reference/protocols) and
the implementations are 
[open source and available on GitHub](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam).

Also available is a published and independent third-party audit by
the security research firm [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com).

## Trust at the application level

Traditional solutions like peering, VPNs, and maintaining allow lists - 
network-level approaches that connect entire networks to each other. To reduce
lateral movement within the networks further controls are then applied. 

By elevating trust to the application level, Ockam provides
fine-grained access controls that map to actual business needs. There's no long-standing
assumptions about networks, and secure communication guarantees 
push beyond network perimeters and system boundaries &mdash; they're
established all the way through to the applications processing your data.

## Data authenticity & integrity

in strong data governance guarantees around the authenticity and integrity of 
the messages moving through your system.
