## App-to-app trust

Kafka applications that are handling sensitive data require more than encryption
to the "end". Where's the "end"? What's needed to meet modern data governance 
expectations are guarantees that the intended applications are exclusively the
apps that can participate in a sensitive message stream. Ockam moves trust to 
the application layer by building a mutually authenticated and encrypted 
communication channel between all of your Kafka apps _through_ your Kafka brokers.

## No more shared secret keys

Sharing secret keys across many apps and services increases the likelihood of
secret keys leaking, in addition to eroding any guarantees that only intended apps can
access sensitive data. Teams then layer in additional credential management 
approaches, network-level controls, and various other security approaches in
an attempt to have a somewhat reliable assumption that only the intended app(s)
were able to use the shared secret keys.

With Ockam, each Kafka app generates it's own _unique_ cryptographically provable identity 
and encryption keys, and uses those keys to establish trusted secure channels directly 
with other authorized apps as required.

## No more shipping secrets

Whether it's reading a credential or secret value from a central source, or 
transmitting a secret key to another app, every time a secret value is transmitted
over the wire is another opportunity for it to leak. Ockam's approach to secret 
management means each secret key never needs to leave the place where it was 
generated. By removing the need to transmit secrets the risk of an attacker 
intercepting a secret in transit is also removed.

<SideBySidePanel textOrientation="right" image="automated-key-rotation">
## Automated & regular key-rotation

Everyone hopes they never have a data breach, but to minimize the impact incase
the worst happens Ockam apps automatically and regularly rotate their encryption
keys. If a secret key is ever leaked the data at risk is reduced to the amount sent
in the small window of that secret key was active. Don't put your 
historical and future data at risk because rotating secret keys is difficult &mdash; 
it's built-in from the start.

<SideBySidePanel textOrientation="left" image="guaranteed-authenticity">
## Data authenticity & integrity

The approach to mutual authentication of every app that Ockam provides results
in strong data governance guarantees around the authenticity and integrity of 
the messages moving through your system.

<SideBySidePanel textOrientation="left" image="kafka-any-language">
## Any language

The Kafka add-on for Ockam can work with any language. You've the flexibility
to write your producers and consumers in a mix of Java, Python, Go, Scala, you 
name it!
</SideBySidePanel>

<SideBySidePanel textOrientation="right" image="no-code-changes">
## No app code changes

Just a single configuration change: update the broker host to point to the secure channel
that Ockam sets up on `localhost` for each app. It takes a couple of seconds,
and won't require you to change any of the business logic or implementation in your
apps.
</SideBySidePanel>


<SideBySidePanel textOrientation="right" image="kafka-heterogeneous">
## Heterogeneous deployments

Ockam's agnostic to network-level and cloud-specific features. Run a mix of apps
across the major cloud vendors to access specific value-add services without 
the complication of configuring secure cross-cloud access to a specific KMS or
setting services like Private Link or VPC Peering.
