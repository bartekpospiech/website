## App-to-app trust

Meeting modern data control expectations requires guarantees that the intended applications are exclusively the apps that can connect to your systems. Ockam moves trust to the application layer by building a mutually authenticated and encrypted communication channel between those systems.

## No more shared secret keys

Sharing secret keys across many apps and services increases the likelihood of secret keys leaking, in addition to eroding any guarantees that only intended apps can access sensitive data. Teams then layer in additional credential management approaches, network-level controls, and various other security approaches in an attempt to have a somewhat reliable assumption that only the intended app(s) were able to use the shared secret keys.

With Ockam, each app generates it's own _unique_ cryptographically provable identity and encryption keys, and uses those keys to establish trusted secure channels directly with other authorized apps as required.

## No more shipping secrets

Whether it's reading a credential or secret value from a central source, or  transmitting a secret key to another app, every time a secret value is transmitted over the wire is another opportunity for it to leak. Ockam's approach to secret management means each secret key never needs to leave the place where it was generated. By removing the need to transmit secrets the risk of an attacker intercepting a secret in transit is also removed.

## Automated & regular key-rotation

Everyone hopes they never have a data breach, but to minimize the impact in case the worst happens Ockam apps automatically and regularly rotate their encryption keys. If a secret key is ever leaked the data at risk is reduced to the amount sent in the small window of that secret key was active. Don't put your historical and future data at risk because rotating secret keys is difficult&mdash; it's built-in from the start.

## Trust your security team can depend on

Ockam's approach uses existing and well established open source
technologies and frameworks. We build trust through transparency so your CISO can be confident everything meets their requirements. The cryptographic and messaging protocols are 
[publicly documented](https://docs.ockam.io/reference/protocols) and
the implementations are 
[open source and available on GitHub](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam). We've published an independent third-party audit by
the security research firm [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com). The [current status of our latest audits and compliance controls](https://audits.ockam.io) are also available.

## No need to run Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

Nobody loves running their own PKI. It's complicated, you still need to work out how to securely handle your root certificate and keys, have policies around  lifecycle management&hellip; a lot of extra infrastructure and orchestration.

With Ockam, each app generates keys and establishes trust directly there's no  need to run your own PKI systems.
